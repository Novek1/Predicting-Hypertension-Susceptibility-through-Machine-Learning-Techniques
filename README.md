# Predicting Hypertension Susceptibility Through Machine Learning Techniques
The Jupyter Notebooks uploaded for this study use Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplot library and Scikit Learn to demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be used to predict patients' hypertension susceptibility. The objective is to classify each patient into the correct hypertension class among the following:
- Normal
- Elevated
- Stage 1 Hypertension
- Stage 2 Hypertension
- Hypertension Crisis

The stratified classification gives a realistic approach from a clinical standpoint of hypertension diagnosis. The modified dataset used is owned by Md Raihan Khan as uploaded onto the Kaggle dataset repository : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khan1803115/hypertension-risk-model-main/data.
